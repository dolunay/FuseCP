# FuseCP

[![Build](https://github.com/FuseCP/FuseCP/actions/workflows/deploy-release.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/FuseCP/FuseCP/actions/workflows/deploy-release.yaml)
[![Test](https://github.com/FuseCP/FuseCP/actions/workflows/test-release.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/FuseCP/FuseCP/actions/workflows/test-release.yaml)

FuseCP is a complete, open-source control panel for Cloud Computing Companies and IT Providers. It lets you provision and manage a full suite of hosted services across your infrastructure from a single web-based administration portal.

> FuseCP is the successor to SolidCP. It is free, open source, and actively developed.

**Website & downloads:** [www.fusecp.com](https://www.fusecp.com)

## What can FuseCP manage?

| Category | Services |
| -------- | -------- |
| **Web hosting** | IIS 10, FTP |
| **Databases** | SQL Server 2022, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, PostgreSQL |
| **Email & collaboration** | Microsoft Exchange SE & 2019, Mailenable, Smartermail |
| **Directory services** | Active Directory |
| **Remote access** | Microsoft RemoteApp / RDS, Guacamole (browser-based RDP/VNC/SSH) |
| **Virtualisation** | Hyper-V, Proxmox |
| **Billing integration** | WHMCS module included |

FuseCP uses a multi-tenant model, meaning one installation can serve multiple resellers and their end customers, each with their own isolated service quotas and hosting plans.

---

## Installing FuseCP

Download the latest release installer from [www.fusecp.com](https://www.fusecp.com) or the [Releases](../../releases) page.

The installer sets up three components on your Windows Server:

| Component | Role |
| --------- | ---- |
| **Portal** | The web-based administration interface (IIS) |
| **Enterprise Server** | The business logic and database service |
| **Server Agent** | Runs on each managed host to execute provisioning actions |

All three can run on the same machine for small deployments, or be split across servers for larger environments.

### Supported platforms

* **Operating system**: Windows Server 2016 / 2019 / 2022 / 2025
* **Database**: SQL Server (Express or full), MySQL, MariaDB
* **.NET**: .NET Framework 4.8 (current release) — .NET 10 support in progress

---

## Getting started

After installation, open the FuseCP Portal URL in a browser. Log in with the administrator account created during setup.

From the portal you can:

1. **Add servers** — register your managed hosts under *Server* → *Servers*
2. **Create hosting plans** — define resource quotas under *System* → *Hosting Plans*
3. **Add resellers and customers** — provision accounts under *Account Management*
4. **Provision services** — assign web, mail, database, and other services to customer packages

Full administration documentation is available at [www.fusecp.com](https://www.fusecp.com).

## Upgrading from SolidCP

FuseCP is a direct successor to SolidCP and maintains database and configuration compatibility. The upgrade path is covered in the installation documentation on [www.fusecp.com](https://www.fusecp.com).

## Architecture

FuseCP is organized into three primary layers:

| Layer | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| **Portal** | ASP.NET (WebForms, migrating to Core) front-end — user-facing web UI |
| **Enterprise Server** | Business logic, database access (EF Core 8 / EF 6), and service orchestration |
| **Server** | Execution agent that runs on managed hosts and carries out provisioning actions |

Source code is under `FuseCP/Sources/`. Build and deployment scripts are under `FuseCP/` and `tools/`.

---

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Notes |
| ----------- | ----- |
| .NET 10 SDK | Required for Core-targeted builds and EF migrations |
| Visual Studio / MSBuild | Required for full orchestrated builds and `.vdproj` installer projects |
| Node.js / npm | Required for portal LESS → CSS compilation (`FuseCP/Sources/FuseCP.WebPortal/App_Themes/Default/Styles/`) |
| PowerShell 7+ (`pwsh`) | Required for all tooling scripts |
| SQL Server Express (local) | Required for integration testing |
| IIS | Required for portal integration tests |
| WiX Toolset v3.14 | Required for legacy installer packaging only |

First-time full setup (elevated PowerShell):

```powershell
powershell -File FuseCP/Tools/bootstrap-test-environment.ps1 `
  -Install -RunAllProfiles -InstallSqlExpress -InstallIIS -InstallWsl -InstallWixToolset
```

Check prerequisites only:

```powershell
pwsh -File FuseCP/Tools/check-test-environment.ps1 -Profile Unit
```

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FuseCP/FuseCP.git
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### 2. Start of day

```powershell
pwsh -File FuseCP/Tools/Start-Of-Day.ps1
```

### 3. Build (debug)

```powershell
# Full orchestrated build
FuseCP/build-debug.bat

# Or via the scripted validation entrypoint (recommended for CI-like local checks)
pwsh -File FuseCP/Tools/run-local-validation.ps1
```

### 4. Validate changed files only (fast loop)

```powershell
pwsh -File FuseCP/Tools/run-local-validation.ps1 -ChangedOnly -SkipIfNoChanges -DisableNuGetAudit
```

### 5. Deploy (debug, local)

```powershell
FuseCP/deploy-debug.bat
```

### 6. End of day

Run the VS Code task **Done for today** or:

```powershell
pwsh -File FuseCP/Tools/Done-For-Today.ps1
```

```

## UI Theme Development (LESS/CSS)

All portal styling is authored in LESS source files — never edit `main.css` directly.

| File | Purpose |
| ---- | ------- |
| `main.less` | Main theme rules — colors, layout, component overrides |
| `Menus.less` | Navigation, menus, popup and grid rules |
| `defaultVariables.less` | Shared LESS variables (`@footer-bg`, Bootstrap overrides, etc.) |
| `defaultTheme.less` | Root entry point — imports all of the above |
| `main.css` | **Compiled output — do not edit** |

Recompile after editing any `.less` file:

```powershell
cd FuseCP/Sources/FuseCP.WebPortal/App_Themes/Default/Styles
npm run build:css
```

Commit both the `.less` source and the recompiled `main.css` together.

---

## Database Schema Changes (Entity Framework)

FuseCP uses EF Core 8 on .NET 10 and EF 6 on .NET Framework, with a single shared `DbContext` in `FuseCP.EnterpriseServer.Data`.

### Workflow

1. Edit Entity class(es) in `FuseCP/Sources/FuseCP.EnterpriseServer.Data/Entities/`.
2. Update Fluent API configuration in `Configuration/` for cross-DB type mapping if needed.
3. Create a migration:

   ```bat
   cd FuseCP/Sources/FuseCP.EnterpriseServer.Data
   MigrationAdd.bat
   ```

4. Review the generated files under `Migrations/`.
5. Also update `FuseCP/Database/update_db.sql` to keep the legacy SQL path in sync.

For scaffolding from an existing database or porting raw SQL changes, see the full guide in [`FuseCP/Sources/FuseCP.EnterpriseServer.Data/README.md`](FuseCP/Sources/FuseCP.EnterpriseServer.Data/README.md).

**Never edit EF model snapshot (`.cs`) files by hand** — always let `dotnet ef` maintain them.

## Validation Reference

```powershell
# Broadest (full build, all scopes)
pwsh -File FuseCP/Tools/run-local-validation.ps1

# Changed files only
pwsh -File FuseCP/Tools/run-local-validation.ps1 -ChangedOnly -SkipIfNoChanges

# Scoped (Portal, Enterprise, or Server)
pwsh -File FuseCP/Tools/run-local-validation.ps1 -Scope Portal

# After initial restore (skip restore for speed)
pwsh -File FuseCP/Tools/run-local-validation.ps1 -Scope Enterprise -NoRestore

# Machine-readable output for PR tooling
pwsh -File FuseCP/Tools/run-local-validation.ps1 -ChangedOnly -JsonOutputPath artifacts/validation/summary.json
```

> In scoped mode, `Portal` already builds `FuseCP.WebPortalAndEnterpriseServer.sln`; selecting both `Portal` and `Enterprise` does not run a redundant extra build.
